Skyscraper source build instructions for Debian Linux
-------------------------------------

Install required stuff:

Debian 11:
---
sudo apt-get install git cmake gcc g++ gcc-doc wx3.0-headers libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev freeglut3-dev zlib1g-dev libfreeimage-dev libfreetype-dev libois-dev libzzip-dev libxaw7-dev libxrandr-dev x11proto-randr-dev nvidia-cg-toolkit libgtk2.0-dev libboost-dev cmake-curses-gui
---

If you have a multi-core system, at the step that says to type "make", you can instead type "make -j2" to build using 2 cores, or "make -j4" for 4 cores.

Step 1 - build and install Bullet
----------
Get Bullet source (my custom-patched version):
---
wget http://skyscraper.tliquest.net/downloads/dev/other_apps/bullet.tar.bz2
---

Extract Bullet:
---
tar xfvj bullet.tar.bz2
---

Build and install Bullet:
---
cd bullet-svn
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fPIC -DINSTALL_EXTRA_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF -DUSE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install
cd
---

If you want to play around with the Bullet demos, remove the "-DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF" portion when running cmake above and then build it.


Step 2 - install the FMOD sound system
----------
Get the related Linux package from:
http://www.fmod.org/download/

(Get the FMOD Studio Programmer's API for Linux)
---
tar xfvz fmodstudioapi20208linux.tar.gz
cd fmodstudioapi20208linux/api/core
sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/fmod
sudo cp -a inc/* /usr/local/include/fmod/
sudo cp -a lib/x86_64/* /usr/local/lib/
cd
---


Step 3 - build and install OGRE
-----------

First get the source:
---
https://skyscraper.tliquest.net/downloads/dev/other_apps/ogre-1.12-skyscraper.tar.gz
tar xfvz ogre-1.12-skyscraper.tar.gz
cd ogre-1.12.13
cmake -DOGRE_CONFIG_DOUBLE=ON -DOGRE_BUILD_SAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOGRE_CONFIG_THREADS=0
make
sudo make install
cd
---

(if you want to install the OGRE samples, for the cmake line above do "cmake -DINSTALL_SAMPLES=ON" instead)


Step 4 - build and install Caelum (sky system)
-----------
This one you can pull from SVN, and I have custom-modified source code.
So pull the source from SVN, and build:

---
git clone https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-caelum.git caelum
cd caelum
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install
cd
---


Step 5 - build a legacy wxWidgets with GTK2 support (this is until the GTK3 rendering issue gets fixed)
-----------
wget https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.0.5/wxWidgets-3.0.5.tar.bz2
tar xfvj wxWidgets-3.0.5.tar.bz2
cd wxWidgets-3.0.5
./configure --prefix=/opt/wx
make
sudo make install
cd


Step 6 - build Skyscraper (this also builds the built-in OgreBullet libraries)
-----------
First grab the source via git, and build, using the wxWidgets we just built.

---
git clone https://github.com/eventhorizon5/skyscraper.git skyscraper
cd skyscraper
wget http://skyscraper.tliquest.net/downloads/dev/other_apps/plugins.cfg
cmake . -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/opt/wx/bin/wx-config
make
---

Finally, run Skyscraper:
---
./skyscraper
---

To update the app in the future, first update git, rebuild and run:
---
git pull
make
./skyscraper
---

If any files were added in git, you'll have to run CMake before the "make" command, or else it'll have linking errors:
---
git pull
cmake .
make
./skyscraper
---
